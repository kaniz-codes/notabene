# Notabene — Notes Organizer

Notabene is a lightweight web app for organizing **course notes, CT questions, videos/playlists, repositories, and study topics** in one place. It’s built so my classmates can access and share course resources easily anytime.


## Why I built this

In many courses, resources get scattered across chat groups, Google Drive links, YouTube playlists, and different GitHub repos. Notabene brings everything into a single, structured dashboard so students can:

- find the right materials quickly
- track which topics are completed
- star important links for fast access
- and share course pages easily with classmates

  - Search courses
  - Filter by semester and type (theory / lab / practice)
  - Favorites-only view
  - Quick stats (total / visible / starred)

- **Course Tabs**
  - Overview, Notes, CT Questions, Videos, Repos, ★ Starred links

- **Favorites**
  - Star courses and individual links

- **Topics Tracker**
  - Add topics
  - Reorder (drag & drop)
  - Mark complete ✅ and view progress
