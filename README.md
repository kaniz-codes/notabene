# Notabene — Notes Organizer

Notabene is a lightweight web app for organizing **course notes, CT questions, videos/playlists, repositories, and study topics** in one place. It’s built so my classmates can access and share course resources easily anytime.


## Why I built this

In many courses, resources get scattered across chat groups, Google Drive links, YouTube playlists, and different GitHub repos. Notabene brings everything into a single, structured dashboard so students can:

- find the right materials quickly
- track which topics are completed
- star important links for fast access
- and share course pages easily with classmates


## How to Use

1. **Open Notabene**
   - go to: [Notabene](https://kaniz-codes.github.io/notabene/)

2. **Select a Course**
   - Choose a course from the left sidebar.
   - Use **Search** or **Semester / Type filters** to find a course faster.

3. **Browse Resources**
   - Use the top tabs to open materials for the course:
     - **Overview** (quick summary)
     - **Notes**
     - **CT Questions**
     - **Videos**
     - **Repos**
     - **★ Favorites** (your starred links)

4. **Work with Topics**
   - The right panel shows the course **Topics**.
   - Some topics may already be added.
   - To add a topic:
     - Type into **“Add a topic”**
     - Click **Add**
   - To mark a topic as finished:
     - Tick ✅ the checkbox next to the topic

5. **Track Your Progress**
