# Notabene — Notes Organizer

Notabene is a lightweight web app for organizing **course notes, CT questions, videos/playlists, repositories, and study topics** in one place. It’s designed so my classmates can access the resources anytime.


## Why I built this

In many courses, resources get scattered across chat groups, Google Drive links, YouTube playlists, and different GitHub repos. Notabene brings everything into a single, structured dashboard so students can:
- find the right materials quickly,
- track what topics are done,
- keep important links starred,
- and share course pages easily with classmates.

## Features

- **Course Sidebar**
  - Search courses
  - Filter by semester and type (theory/lab/practice)
  - Favorites
  - Quick stats (total/visible/starred)
- **Course Tabs**
  - Overview, Notes, CT Questions, Videos, Repos, ★ Starred links
- **Favorites**
  - Star courses and individual links
- **Topics Tracker**
  - Add topics, reorder (drag & drop), mark complete, view progress
- **Theme Toggle**
  - Dark / Light mode
- **Shareable Course Links**
  - Copy a course link like to open directly on that course
